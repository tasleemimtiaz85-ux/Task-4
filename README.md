# Task-4
4th task of my Internship 
🌌 Fraud Detection in Application Data | 🧠 Data Analytics & Machine Learning Project
🚀 Project Overview: Unmasking Anomalies through Data Intelligence
In a digital era where millions of applications flow through online systems every day, identifying fraudulent or suspicious activity has become a mission-critical task. 🕵️‍♂️💻 Through this project, I take a data-driven journey to uncover hidden patterns, detect anomalies, and build predictive intelligence that flags potential fraudulent applications — leveraging the full power of Python, machine learning, and data visualization. This end-to-end project combines analytical rigor and visual storytelling to reveal how data science can protect systems, improve decision-making, and enhance the integrity of digital applications. ⚙️📊

🎯 Project Synopsis
The Fraud Detection in Application Data Project is a comprehensive analytical and machine learning initiative designed to detect unusual, inconsistent, or potentially fraudulent records within a large dataset of application details. Using unsupervised learning models like Isolation Forest and K-Means Clustering, alongside advanced preprocessing and visualization, the project transforms raw application data into actionable fraud insights — enabling early detection of suspicious patterns and outliers.
